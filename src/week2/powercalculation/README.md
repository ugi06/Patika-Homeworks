# Power Calculation Algorithm
***
* 1) Number and power data are received from the user and the answer is returned.
* 2) In addition to integers and integer powers, the variable double is defined for more general square roots or powers of decimal numbers.
* 3) This operation is defined in the Math class as Math.pow(a,b) but for the method implementation static double method was used. 
```java
static double powerCalculation(double number1 , double number2){

        return Math.pow(number1,number2);
    }
```
